title: "Making the Most Out of 'M' Mode"
---
Have you ever noted that your Mixed Mode course ends up looking suspiciously identical to your F2F courses? This realization struck me and one of my colleagues recently, and we are now working to form a faculty group to make the most out of our various course modailities. I am particularly interested in 'M' mode courses, and the half-online, half-in person experience that they provide for our students.
