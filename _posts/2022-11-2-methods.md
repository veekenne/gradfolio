title: "The Great British Baking Show Technical Challenge: Your IMRAD Methods Section"
---

When teaching the Methods Section in English Composition II, I use baking as a metaphor. Baking is, after all, quite a bit like Chemistry (or research), although hopefully much tastier. Here are the lecture slides and activities I use in this unit: [Technical Challenge: Your IMRAD Methods Section](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A8j7TGcGlXKfVneHi-2SV9_Y3qMg5psGRU6kOY8nlh4/edit?usp=sharing/){:target="_blank}. Students particularly enjoy supplementing this lecture with a literal example of the telephone game and instructor-provided baked goods.
