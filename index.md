[Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

I have taught in the U.S., Japan and China as teacher of record at universities, corporate for-profit English Language programs, and at private schools. My oldest students have been senior citizens and my youngest were toddlers. I hold certification as a TEFL Instructor through the International TEFL Academy with coursework completed in English for Academic Purposes, Business English, and English for Young Learners.
