Hi! I'm Vee Kennedy (they/them/theirs) and I'm presently a Visiting Instructor in the Department of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Central Florida. I'm also planning to apply to the [Texts and Technology PhD Program](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/){:target="_blank"} at UCF and am currently trying out some coursework to see if the program is a good fit for me. My research interests are at the intersections of queer and trans rhetorics, gender, fandom and disability studies.    

I also presently maintain a very ugly, very out of date [Wordpress Site](https://kellyveekennedy.com){:target="blank"} that contains a bit more of my academic accomplishments as I strive to actually teach myself to code properly. Hopefully, this site will someday take it's place!
