Hi! I'm Vee Kennedy (they/them/theirs) and I'm a Visiting Instructor in the Department of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Central Florida. I'm also a student in the [Texts and Technology PhD Program](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/){:target="_blank"} at UCF. My research interests are at the intersections of queer and trans rhetorics, game studies, fandom, neurodivergence and (dis)ability. 

I am many things, among them, autistic and chronically ill. My greatest goal within my scholarly work is to improve the experiences of neurodivergent college students in their transition to the undergraduate experience. A great place to start learning more about the need for improving these support systems for allies, and for disabled student advocates ourselves, is the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network's [Empowering Leadership: A Systems Change Guide for Autistic College Students and Those with Other Disabilities](https://autisticadvocacy.org/resources/books/empowering-leadership-a-systems-change-guide-for-autistic-college-students-and-those-with-other-disabilities/){:target="_blank}.
