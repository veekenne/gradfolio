Hi! I'm Vee Kennedy (they/them/theirs) and I'm presently an Instructor in the Department of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Central Florida. I'm also planning to apply to the [Texts and Technology PhD Program](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/){:target="_blank"} at UCF and am currently trying out some coursework to see if the program is a good fit for me. 

[Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

Here's a blurb.
