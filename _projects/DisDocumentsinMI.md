title: A Culture of (in)Access
description:  The disability friendliness of the First-Year Writing Programs of the Public Universities of Michigan as manifested by course documents
---

The conversation around including college students with disabilities in the first-year composition classroom has moved from a question of if disabled students should be allowed to enter these spaces at all to how instructors and institutions can be more equitably inclusive. This research seeks to investigate if evidence of this cultural shift toward inclusion is present in our classrooms by examining the rhetorical work conducted by the disability accommodation statements on first-year composition course syllabi collected from public universities in the State of Michigan. Not only are course documents and syllabi rhetorical genres by which to study how disability culture is currently manifested within our classrooms, but also, malleable tools Instructors can use to create change indicative of inclusion. The evidence collected suggests that although much been done to further the goal of inclusion, the syllabus accommodation statement remains and underutilized resource in creating inclusive classroom spaces. Recommendations for Writing Program Administrators from this body of evidence include aligning university-provided language and protocol with syllabus language, using disability-related language that is current and exemplifies best praxis, and creating scripts for ongoing dialogue about accessibility and accommodations to facilitate dynamic conversations between faculty, students, and university resources.
