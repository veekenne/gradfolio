*Hollow Reign* is the story of an accidental queer space pirate kid turned fake princess changing the Worlds, one lie at a time. After sixteen-year-old Pietro’s third gender infraction, their family is fined a debilitating fee that will leave them homeless and destitute. To spare them, Pietro runs away and joins a band of queer space pirates. There, they are caught up in an anarchist scheme to impersonate a dead princess and lead a coup against the Queen. If Pietro succeeds, they’ll topple the whole system of discrimination that got them into this mess to begin with, but they might start an intergalactic war and lose their family in the process. Story by Vincent Volta Volgate, illustrations by Rowan Westmoreland. 

*Hollow Reign* is currently on hiatus. When we are active, this web series is updated on the first Thursday of each month.
