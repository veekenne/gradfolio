title: Syllabus Accessability Statement
description: My Dream Statement of Access
---

I am committed to making our classroom culture inclusive. If you are a student with a
disability or you think you may have a disability, including mental health conditions such
as but not limited to depression and/or anxiety, please contact me as soon as possible to
discuss ways in which I can better accommodate your learning needs. While we may also
discuss university procedures for establishing formal accommodations, I do not require
that my students are registered with the campus Disability Resource Center to discuss
these needs. I welcome this conversation at any time, from any student, regardless of
diagnosis, documents, or lack thereof. The [Campus Resource Center] is located in
[Location] and can be reached at [Contact Information] . Depending on your support needs, you may also benefit from other services on campus or in our community, as
outlined in the Student Resources section of this syllabus.
